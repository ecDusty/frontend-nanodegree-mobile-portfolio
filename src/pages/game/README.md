WELCOME TO ecDUSTY'S FROGGER!
            RE-IMAGINED
            
This isn't your tradition frogger game. Here you're trying to reach the highest possible level you can without getting eaten alive by the deadly bugs, or drowning in the water. If only you learned to swim when you were younger.

To start this game make sure you have unzipped all properties of this game into one single folder. Do not changed the files structure of all the files

To get started:

1) Open the index.html file in your browser. This will work with Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox. I'm not sure with other browsers because I have not had a chance to test them (But I say hey, give it a go!).

2) The game will load itself and start playing immediately.

3) The Controls:
    UP ARROW:    Moves player up 1 space
    DOWN ARROW:  Moves player down 1 space
    LEFT ARROW:  Moves player left 1 space
    RIGHT ARROW: Moves player right 1 space
    
    "P" KEY:     This opens the character selection menu
    "R" KEY:     Resets the game to the start. Don't worry, you wont lose your high score ;)
    
4) The key is to pick up as many gems as possible. Watch out though, those bugs are nasty!

5) Most importantly, you gotta have fun! Challenge your colleagues or friends!
